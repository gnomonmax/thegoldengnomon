# The Golden Gnomon — Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) Theory

This is the official repository for **thegoldengnomon.com**, the public hub for the **Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD)** theory and the **genetic equidistance phenomenon**.

Our mission is to explain, document, and share the evidence for MGD — a framework for understanding biodiversity, human origins, and molecular evolution.

## 📚 What is MGD?
The **Maximum Genetic Diversity theory** proposes that:
- Genetic diversity within a species reaches a species-specific maximum limit.
- The **genetic equidistance phenomenon** is a direct consequence of this limit.
- Molecular evolution is shaped more by diversity constraints than by time alone.

## 🧭 The Golden Gnomon
A **gnomon** is a rule of operation that, when applied to an existing pattern, creates a new pattern that is both distinct and self-similar to the original.  
The **golden gnomon** refers to the gnomon of the golden triangle — a metaphor for the iterative, self-similar process of creation in evolution.  
Our goal in evolutionary biology is to uncover the “gnomon” that drives the endless generation of life’s diversity.
