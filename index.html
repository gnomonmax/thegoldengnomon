    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This is the official website for Professor Shi Huang and the Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) Theory. This site explores the groundbreaking discovery of the <strong>Genetic Equidistance Phenomenon</strong> and its implications for human origins, 
        including the revolutionary <strong>Out of East Asia Theory</strong> as an alternative to the traditional Out of Africa model. Our mission is to explain, document, and share the evidence for MGD — a framework for understanding biodiversity, human origins, and molecular evolution.</p>
    <p>The Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) theory was inspired by an independent rediscovery of the genetic equidistance phenomenon (GEP), first described in 1963. The GEP initially led to the molecular clock hypothesis, which in turn inspired the neutral theory. The molecular clock has since been proven incorrect and discarded. The MGD theory has emerged as a more accurate interpretation of the GEP, overturning numerous phylogenetic conclusions based on the now-debunked neutral theory. It challenges traditional views on human origins by emphasizing the saturation of genetic diversity. The theory supports the Out of East Asia model of modern human origins.</p>
    <p>Unlike the Neutral Theory, MGD argues that physiological selection and natural selection maintains genetic diversity at an optimal maximum, shaping evolutionary outcomes differently.</p>
    <p>In geometry, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon_(figure)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>gnomon</strong></a> is a figure that, when combined with an existing shape, produces a new figure similar to the original. This concept was introduced in Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> (Book II, Definition 2) and has been generalized to describe any rule of transformation that generates patterns that are both distinct and self-similar. The golden gnomon refers to the gnomon of the golden triangle — a metaphor for the iterative, self-similar process of creation in evolution. Our goal in evolutionary biology is to uncover the “gnomon” that drives the endless generation of life’s diversity and complexity/order.</p>

  <!-- Concepts List -->
  <ul>
    <li id="gep"><strong>GEP (Genetic Equidistance Phenomenon)</strong>: A simpler species is equally distantly related to two or more complex species in a sequence alignment when the genetic distance is measured by the identity matrix or percentage non-identity.</li>
    <li id="mgd"><strong>MGD (Maximum Genetic Diversity)</strong>: The upper limit in genetic distance or diversity, as measured by the identity matrix or percentage differences, that can be reached during evolution over long periods. The new concept of maximum genetic diversity is mainly in regard to the form of genetic diversity as measured by genetic distance.</li>
    <li id="microevolution"><strong>Microevolution</strong>: In the MGD theory, the term encompasses evolutionary changes both within a species and between species over both short and long periods, as long as these changes do not involve major epigenetic modifications.</li>
    <li id="macroevolution"><strong>Macroevolution</strong>: In the MGD theory, the term describes new species formation that involves both genetic and epigenetic changes, particularly involving increases in epigenetic complexity.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Axioms -->
  <h3 id="axiom1">Axiom 1</h3>
  <p>The more complex the phenotype, the greater the restriction on the choice of molecular building blocks. Complex/ordered systems need higher precision building parts. In biology, this means there is an inverse relationship between genetic diversity and epigenetic complexity. Complexity is defined as the number of cell types.</p>

  <h3 id="axiom2">Axiom 2</h3>
  <p>For any system that can allow a limited level of random errors or noises in molecular building parts, such errors may be beneficial, deleterious, or neutral depending on circumstances. Limited errors at optimum level are more likely to be beneficial than deleterious because they are, after all, within tolerable levels and confer economy in construction and the strongest possible adaptive capacity or robustness to environmental challenges. In biology, substituting “errors in building blocks” with “genetic diversity” gives the equivalent concept. Axiom 2 in fact highlights the valid parts of Kimura’s and Darwin’s theories.</p>

  <h3 id="axiom3">Axiom 3</h3>
  <p>Matter or randomness and consciousness or cognition are opposite to each other. High randomness inside the body of an individual must result in poor mental function, and the measure of randomness is genetic diversity, as diversity originates from random mutational events. Thus, complex species with higher cognitive capacity must have lower randomness or genetic diversity.</p>

  <h3 id="axiom4">Axiom 4</h3>
  <p>Deleterious mutations, which impair a trait, can be mitigated by compensatory mutations. Populations with high genetic diversity are better equipped to tolerate or counteract harmful mutations, making it challenging for natural selection to maintain trait quality and eliminate detrimental variants. Therefore, reducing genetic diversity may be necessary to preserve high-quality traits and effectively remove harmful mutations.</p>


  <h3 id="core">Core Principles of the MGD Theory</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
      <p>Maximum genetic diversity tends to be higher for simpler taxa and lower for more complex taxa.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Macroevolution involves changes in organismal complexity and often results in an increase in complexity, which is mirrored by an increase in the precision of the building parts or a decrease in the allowed range of the standard deviations for the parts. Microevolution, on the other hand, is an increase in genetic diversity within the allowed standard deviation ranges without significant change in complexity. It encompasses both evolution within species and evolution from one species to another. At the saturation phase, microevolution involves turnover of alleles at the equilibrium level of genetic diversity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The positions that are conserved in simpler taxa tend to also be conserved in more complex taxa. The positions that are free to change in more complex taxa tend to also be free to change in simpler taxa.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Genetic distance among taxa and genetic diversity within a taxon is mostly at the optimum level today after a very long evolutionary time, especially so for fast-evolving sequences. Any level higher or lower than the optimum would be negatively selected. As genetic diversity, so long it is within the maximum level, facilitates adaptation, it would be positively selected to quickly reach the optimum level. The optimum concept here means a Pareto optimum or simply the best that can be achieved due to a balance between positive and negative selection at a particular time point under a specific level of epigenetic or organismal complexity. As time, environments, and complexity changes, the optimum level of nucleotide diversity will also change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Genetic variants are mostly functional or under balancing selection and quasi-neutral (under both positive and negative selection) rather than neutral.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Genetic distance or molecular distance between two taxa of different complexity is not contributed equally by mutations in the two lineages but rather is mostly contributed by mutations in the simpler lineage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Non-conservation is not non-function. Fast-changing non-conserved sequences play more important roles in adaptation to the environment than the slowly changing conserved housekeeping genes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lower MGD means higher homozygosity, which is however very different from the higher homozygosity due to inbreeding. Lower MGD results in higher fitness traits because there are more common alleles or good alleles becoming homozygous. In contrast, inbreeding leads to lower fitness traits (inbreeding depression) due to homozygosity in minor alleles or deleterious alleles. Inbreeding shows long runs of homozygosity (ROH) but lower MGD does not.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The origin of the first life involves a reduction in the randomness of the life-building molecules, which is fundamentally similar to the reduction in genetic diversity or randomness during the step-wise increase in complexity in macroevolution. They all involve the same complexifying force or anti-randomness force.</p>
    </li>

<p><strong>Schematic representation of the maximum genetic diversity theory  of evolution.</strong> A. Macroevolution. As species evolves from simple to complex (taxon A to taxon E), the maximum level of genetic diversity that a taxon can tolerate gets reduced. B. Microevolution. Accumulation of random mutations within the tolerated range of genetic diversity leads to speciation (from taxon A to taxon B) without much changes in epigenetic complexity or the level of maximum genetic diversity that a taxon can tolerate. </p>
    <h3 id="gep-reinterpreted">GEP reinterpreted by MGD</h3>

     <p>The MGD theory explains the GEP as a result of maximum genetic distance. Over a long evolutionary time and for fast-evolving DNAs, the genetic distance between species has reached the maximum level. The distance between the ingroup species and a simpler outgroup taxon is mainly determined by the maximum genetic diversity of the simpler outgroup. This distance is equal to the maximum distance allowed within members of the simpler outgroup, e.g., the distance between humans and fishes equals the maximum distance between different taxa of fishes. Changes in the lineage leading to the simpler outgroup mask any changes in the lineages leading to the ingroup taxa.</p>
<p>There are in fact two kinds of genetic equidistance results. For long evolutionary timescale or for fast-evolving sequences, one would observe “maximum genetic equidistance”: different species are equidistant to a species of lower or equal complexity. The original result of Margoliash is maximum genetic equidistance. For short evolutionary timescale or for slow evolving sequences, one observes “linear genetic equidistance” where the molecular clock holds and the distance is still linearly related to time: when ingroup species have similar mutation rates, they would be equidistant to a lower or equal complexity outgroup. </p>
  <p>This explanation of the genetic equidistance result by the MGD theory can also be easily illustrated by a simple thought experiment. If we can create a yeast, a fish, and a human being by using identical genes for their shared homologs and let the three organisms diverge for an infinite amount of time or about 500 million years with each organism remains phenotypical largely the same as today, a gene in yeast would have changed a lot to a maximum of, say 50%, while its homolog in fish would have changed to a maximum of, say, 30%, and its homolog in human would have changed very little, say less than 1%. Any more changes than 50% would be lethal to yeast; any more changes than 30% would be lethal to fishes; and any more changes than 1% would be lethal to humans. The reason that a gene in yeast can change much more than in fish, which is still more than in human, is because a gene in human encounters far more functional constraints than its homolog in fish or in yeast. Thus the genetic distance between yeast and human or fish is mainly determined by the mutations in yeast. In this case, the 50% change in yeast would account for the genetic distance of 50% identity between yeast and human or between yeast and fish, as well as 50% identity in within species distance in yeast. The 30% change in fish would account for the genetic distance of 30% identity between fish and human. In contrast, the neutral theory would predict that both human and fish can also, like yeast, change up to 50% or more and would have a genetic distance of 50% identity.</p>

    <li id="overlap-feature">
      <strong>The overlap feature</strong>: There are three ways to test which of the two different interpretations of genetic equidistance is true, the molecular clock versus the MGD theory. The first is the overlap feature of mutations. When aligning a protein sequence from three taxa, the conserved positions would show identical amino acids for all three taxa. The non-conserved positions can be categorized into two types. One type involves mutation in only one of the three taxa, while the other two taxa retain either identical amino acids or remain unchanged. The second type consists of positions where each taxon has a unique amino acid at the same location (the red colored positions in the Figure below). This indicates that at least two taxa had gone through a unique mutation at that same position, and hence their mutations overlapped at that position. Such positions are referred to as overlap positions. Since one mutation is enough to lead to a difference of one between two taxa as measured by identity matrix, overlapped mutations at the same position do not increase molecular distances and are hence hallmarks of mutation saturation. At maximum saturation, each free-to-change position in a taxon would have mutated, resulting in a higher fraction of overlap positions among the non-conserved positions than expected by chance. This is termed the high overlap ratio (HOR) phenomenon.

<p><strong>Figure.  The genetic equidistance result and the maximum genetic diversity theory.  </strong> A. Maximum genetic equidistance. A ten amino acid peptide is used to illustrate the evolution process. When the protein is fast evolving, the observed equidistance today would be maximum distance with a high overlap ratio. The figure shows 4 overlap positions with an overlap ratio 1. The distance of C-A is 60%, the same as that of that of B-A. This is a schematic representation of the original Margoliash genetic equidistance result. 
B.  An example of maximum genetic equidistance.  Alignment of human, drosophila, and yeast cytochrome C proteins. Human differs from drosophila in 22 amino acid positions. Human and drosophila are equidistant to yeast with 36 amino acid differences. There are 12 overlap positions (in red color) and the overlap ratio is 12/22 = 55%. Other mutant positions are colored in green, blue and orange. 
C, Linear genetic equidistance. When the protein is slowly evolving, assuming molecular clock holds, the observed equidistance today would be linear distance with a low overlap ratio. Here every substitution in any species would mean an increase in distance. The figure shows 0 overlap position with an overlap ratio 0. The distance of C-A is 50% and equals that of B-A. 
D. An example of linear equidistance. Human, orangutan, and mouse TXND9 gene alignment. There are 2 amino acid difference between human and orangutan, which are equidistant to mouse with 6 amino acid differences. The overlap ratio is 0/2 = 0.  
 </p>
  
    
    </li>

    <li id="genetic-non-equidistance">
      <strong>Genetic non-equidistance</strong>: The second way to test the molecular clock versus the MGD theory is the genetic non-equidistance result despite equidistance in time. The MGD theory predicts that maximum equidistance would only result when the outgroup is less complex than the sister species. If the outgroup is more complex, then its maximum distance with the ingroup sister species would be determined by the MGD of each of the ingroup species, which may not be the same for all the ingroup species. However, the molecular clock would predict genetic equidistance to the outgroup regardless if the outgroup taxon is more or less complex. For example, human is the outgroup to the Sauropsida clade containing snake and bird. The molecular clock predicts that humans should be equidistant to snakes and birds in protein sequence. However, the MGD theory predicts that birds should be closer to humans than snakes should because birds should be more complex than snakes.</li>
      <p>The actual data in fact validated the MGD theory. Genetic non-equidistance to humans despite equidistance in time has also been found for sister species within the teleost fish clade, the arthropod phylum, the Porifera phylum, and the fungi kingdom. In all five cases where the difference in complexity of the ingroup sister species can be intuitively inferred (octopus vs. cockle, terebratulina vs. lingula, bird vs. snake, dragonfly vs. louse, and smut vs. yeast), the more complex species always shows greater sequence similarity to humans in fast-evolving genes, fully conforming to the predictions of the MGD theory but not that of the molecular clock. It has recently been shown that octopus indeed has the lowest heterozygosity level among mollusks, and that the highest heterozygosity level among mollusks is found for the least complex solenogastres. Also, by whole genome sequencing analysis, two new world monkeys are found to be non-equidistant in nucleotide sequence to humans with the most primitive monkey marmoset to be more distant to humans than the owl monkey.</p>

    <li id="ancient-dna-proteins">
      <strong>Ancient DNA/proteins</strong>: The third way to test the molecular clock versus the MGD theory is to make use of ancient DNA/proteins. Under the molecular clock (MC) and neutral theory, an ancient species should exhibit less sequence divergence from an outgroup than its extant sister species, as it has had less time to accumulate genetic changes (Figure below). However, the MGD theory posits that ancient DNA should be more divergent from the outgroup than its extant sister species.
    </li>
  <p>Consider three extant species of similar phenotypic complexity: A, B, and C, where A and B are sister ingroup species, and C is the outgroup. According to the GEP and MGD theory, A and B are equidistant to C, with the distance at an upper limit for fast-evolving genes. Due to differing environmental conditions, ancient species would share variants adapted to past environments, which would have been replaced in their extant lineages by alleles suited to current environments. Consequently, the genetic identity between B and C (or A and C, as BC = AC per the GEP) would be greater than that between ancient B and extant C (Figure). However, for slowly-evolving genes and for an ancient taxon from the relatively recent past, the B-C identity is expected to be comparable to the B(ancient)-C identity, as significant evolutionary changes are unlikely to accumulate over a relatively short period.</li>

  <p>The maximum genetic diversity theory has been instrumental in directing productive research on both evolutionary problems and important biomedical problems. The theory does not mean discarding the old assumptions but merely making them more limited in their scopes. One must carefully select those DNAs that may follow those assumptions.</p>
  
  <h3 id="phylogenetics">Phylogenetics</h3>
  <p>The maximum genetic diversity theory should help resolve difficult historical problems such as the phylogenetic tree of life. Past methods have no concept of maximum distance and use mostly non-informative distance data for inferring phylogeny. The slow clock method based on the MGD theory makes use of only slow evolving sequences and thus ensures the linear relationship between distance and time. Its results therefore will be more objective and independent of the variations in sequence selections and investigators. The slow clock method has re-established a primate phylogeny that humans and pongids are two separate groups, which has long been the consensus view of paleoanthropologists.</p>
  <p>To truly neutral sequences still at the linear phase of divergence, many of the assumptions of the neutral theory such as the infinite sites model would be valid. Thus phylogenetics research can largely proceed as before except that one has now a standard to separate the neutral from the noninformative DNAs. One must now distinguish two different kinds of high sequence similarity, one due to less time of separation and the other because of common construction resulting in using similar parts (convergent evolution).</p>
  
  <h3 id="origins">Origins of Modern Humans — Recent Out of East Asia Theory</h3>
  <p>The out of Africa model of modern human origins is based on the molecular clock and the neutral theory. The high genetic diversity of Africans is interpreted to mean a deeper evolutionary time for Africans if one assumes the molecular clock. Also, the infinite site model is assumed in order to infer the derived allele status, which is critical for rooting the phylogenetic tree in Africans by using the outgroup rooting method. However, both of these assumptions are invalid according to the MGD theory and experimental data. By using informative variants and allowing recurrent and back mutations, we have built a new model of modern human origins, the Recent out of East Asia (ROE) model. The ROE model is consistent with the multiregional model in terms of autosomal evidence, which indicates that the major races have separated for ~2 million years as originally claimed by the multiregional model. However, uniparental DNA data indicates a single origin in East Asia at a more recent time.</p>
  <p>The likely scenario is that modern humans first evolved in East Asia as marked by a new modern version of uniparental DNAs and then migrated to Europe and Africa and admixed with local less modern people. Admixture led to replacement of uniparental DNAs and autosomal DNAs so that Europeans or Africans would have modern uniparental DNAs but largely local autosomal DNAs. Ancient human DNA should be very informative in falsifying the incorrect models. Our analysis of ancient DNA samples have confirmed the ROA model. In contrast, researchers who believe in the out of Africa model have yet to report any ancient DNA evidence for their model but have instead found support for the ROE model, i.e., ancient DNA samples of 40,000–45,000 years old found in Europe and East Asia are East Asian-like rather than African-like.</p>

  <h3 id="biomedical">Biomedical Problems — Complex Diseases and Traits</h3>
  <p>Most complex traits and diseases are partly inheritable and presumably caused by polymorphic genetic variations such as SNPs. The neutral theory views most such variations to be nonfunctional and neutral and hence the study of complex traits and diseases has in the past focused on searching for a few functional variants. Although such GWAS studies have met some successes in identifying a number of variants, these variants account for only a small fraction of the total trait variation and their functional roles typically remain unclear.</p>
  <p>The maximum genetic diversity theory predicts that complex diseases may be caused by excess genetic noise over a threshold and may serve to prevent an infinite increase in genetic diversity. Complex traits evolved as a result of suppressing genetic noises and hence should be susceptible to damage by excess noises. Also, insufficient amount of genetic diversity may hurt adaptive capacities such as immunity. The quantitative variations in a complex trait may correlate with the number of genetic variations.</p>
  <p>Results from our efforts in testing the MGD theory have shown the expected pattern that higher minor allele contents (MAC) or noises correlate with many complex diseases. These include association of MAC with higher lung cancer incidence in mice and humans. Also, Parkinson’s disease patients have higher MAC than controls and a selected set of ~37,000 minor alleles can predict 2% of Parkinson’s patients. Other diseases that show higher MAC include schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer, and Alzheimer’s.</p>
  <p>To directly examine the self-evident antagonistic relationship between cognition or consciousness and randomness or genetic diversity, we have performed a study analyzing the genotype and phenotype data from more than 400,000 people in the UK. We calculated multiple measures of genetic diversity for each individual, and examined which traits these measures were associated with using linear regression analysis that has controlled for confounding factors. Among the 17 traits examined, only educational attainment, which is highly correlated with cognition or IQ, has the most robust relationship with genetic diversity, and it is an inverse association. This association is likely to be causal, since only the brain-expressed genes, but not the brain-non-expressed genes, showed an association. This result is likely to be free from the interference of confounding factors, because the correlation of non-synonymous variants is significantly higher than that of synonymous variants or intronic variants. Consistently, animal studies have also revealed an inverse relationship between learning and memory and genetic diversity.</p>
  
  <h3 id="why-sex">Why Sex?</h3>
  <p>Almost all eukaryotes reproduce sexually, through a meiosis which generates haploid gametes from a diploid cell. The purpose of sex has long remained a mystery. The common explanation is that sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity. However, asexual organisms such as bacteria generally have much higher genetic diversity than eukaryotes. There is also the suggestion that sexual reproduction can remove chromosomal and epigenetic abnormalities or other deleterious mutations. However, such abnormalities could also be removed by natural selection of abnormal phenotypes.</p>
  <p>The MGD theory offers a straightforward solution to the mystery of sex. According to the theory, macroevolution from a simple taxon to a higher complexity taxon requires a reduction in genetic diversity (at the nucleotide level). The reduction in genetic diversity in an individual of the simple taxon is necessary for the individual to become the incipient individual of the more complex new taxon. As the overall level of genetic variation in an offspring is mostly determined by the inheritance of the combination of single nucleotide variants carried by the parents, sexual reproduction can either increase or decrease the genetic variation in an offspring relative to the parents but asexual reproduction can only increase the genetic variation in an offspring. Thus, sexual reproduction is essential for reducing genetic diversity necessary for the macroevolution of higher complexity.</p>

  <section id="FAQ">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p>Frequently asked questions about the Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) theory and related topics:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is the MGD theory?</dt>
      <dd>The MGD theory, developed by Dr. Shi Huang, posits that genetic diversity reaches an upper limit determined by species complexity, challenging the neutral theory and supporting the "out of East Asia" model of human origins. It reinterprets the **GEP (Genetic Equidistance Phenomenon)** to suggest natural selection maintains this maximum.</dd>
      <dt>Does maximum genetic diversity mean a stop of evolution? </dt>
      <dd>No. Mutation followed by either drift or selection will always occur.</dd>
      <dt>Can the neutral theory be called a no-MGD theory? </dt>
      <dd>Yes. </dd>
      <dt>How does the 'out of East Asia' hypothesis differ from 'out of Africa'?</dt>
      <dd>The 'out of East Asia' hypothesis, based on MGD, argues that modern humans originated in East Asia, supported by ancient DNA showing closer genetic ties to Asians than Africans. The 'out of Africa' model claims a southern African origin around 50,000 years ago, based on the debunked molecular clock hypothesis and the neutral theory. It misinterprets the higher genetic diversity of sub-Sahara Africans as still scaling with time rather than already at the upper limit level. </dd>
       <dt>How do you refute the bottleneck hypothesis of the out of Africa theory?</dt>
      <dd>The bottleneck hypothesis proposes that the lower genetic diversity of non-Africans, compared to Africans, can be explained by a near-extinction event affecting the groups that left Africa for Eurasia. This idea can be challenged on several grounds:
•	Contrary real-world examples – Populations known to have undergone severe bottlenecks, such as the indigenous peoples of Australia and the Americas, actually exhibit higher genetic diversity than East Asians. East Asians, despite being the largest population on Earth and showing no evidence of past bottlenecks, have the lowest genetic diversity.
•	Pattern of fixed alleles – East Asians have more fixed derived alleles, particularly in fast-evolving genes. Bottlenecks should not preferentially fix fast-evolving alleles over slow-evolving ones.
•	Variant-type diversity differences – The diversity gap between Africans and non-Africans is much larger for fast-evolving variants than for slow-evolving variants, which is inconsistent with the expected uniform diversity reduction from a bottleneck.

      <dt>Is the MGD theory widely accepted?</dt>
      <dd>The MGD theory is innovative and controversial, facing resistance from mainstream academia due to its challenge to the neutral theory. However, it is gaining attention, as seen in media coverage and ongoing research, though it requires further validation.</dd>
