    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This is the official website for Professor Shi Huang and the Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) Theory. This site explores the groundbreaking discovery of the <strong>Genetic Equidistance Phenomenon</strong> and its implications for human origins, including the revolutionary <strong>Out of East Asia Theory</strong> as an alternative to the traditional Out of Africa model. Our mission is to explain, document, and share the evidence for MGD — a framework for understanding biodiversity, human origins, and molecular evolution.</p>

    <p>The Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) theory was inspired by an independent rediscovery of the genetic equidistance phenomenon (GEP), first described in 1963. The GEP initially led to the molecular clock hypothesis, which in turn inspired the neutral theory. The molecular clock has since been proven incorrect and discarded. The MGD theory has emerged as a more accurate interpretation of the GEP, overturning numerous phylogenetic conclusions based on the now-debunked neutral theory. It challenges traditional views on human origins by emphasizing the saturation of genetic diversity. The theory supports the Out of East Asia model of modern human origins.</p>

    <p>Unlike the Neutral Theory, MGD argues that physiological selection and natural selection maintains genetic diversity at an optimal maximum, shaping evolutionary outcomes differently.</p>

    <p>In geometry, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon_(figure)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>gnomon</strong></a> is a figure that, when combined with an existing shape, produces a new figure similar to the original. This concept was introduced in Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> (Book II, Definition 2) and has been generalized to describe any rule of transformation that generates patterns that are both distinct and self-similar. The golden gnomon refers to the gnomon of the golden triangle — a metaphor for the iterative, self-similar process of creation in evolution. Our goal in evolutionary biology is to uncover the “gnomon” that drives the endless generation of life’s diversity and complexity/order.</p>

<p><strong>Figure. Illustration of the genetic equidistance phenomenon and its interpretation known as the molecular clock.</strong> Comparison for tetrapod species (T1–T3; human, bird, frog), which are known to have a most recent common ancestor (T), and another species (X; fish). Time flows from the past (left) to the present (right). Species X is the outgroup species and is equally distant to species T1–T3, the ingroup species, both in terms of time of separation and sequence difference, as measured by the identity matrix. This is illustrated by the lines linking X to T1, T2, and T3 being of equal length, indicating the same level of divergence in both time and sequence. The GEP refers to the fact that X is equally different in protein sequence to T1, T2, and T3. Evolutionary lineages leading to species T1–T3 separated from the lineage leading to X at the same point, V. Furthermore, species T1–T3 are products of an evolutionary process that has been ongoing for the same duration since their common ancestor, V. Therefore, if a given protein exhibits equal divergence when comparing the same fish protein with proteins from different tetrapods, it suggests that the rate at which differences accumulate is similar among tetrapods (T1–T3). The implicit assumption here is that the molecular distance among the species has not yet reached its maximum level, allowing us to infer the rate at which sequence differences accumulate. If, however, the distance has reached an upper limit, it would no longer be related to time or mutation rate, rendering the inference of the rate invalid. </p>

  <li id="overlap-feature"> 
    <strong>The overlap feature</strong>: There are three ways to test which of the two different interpretations of genetic equidistance is true, the molecular clock versus the MGD theory. When aligning a protein sequence from three taxa, the conserved positions would show identical amino acids for all three taxa. The non-conserved positions can be categorized into two types. One type involves mutation in only one of the three taxa, while the other two taxa retain either identical amino acids or remain unchanged. The second type consists of positions where each taxon has a unique amino acid at the same location (the red colored positions in the Figure below). This indicates that at least two taxa had gone through a unique mutation at that same position, and hence their mutations overlapped at that position. Such positions are referred to as overlap positions. Since one mutation is enough to lead to a difference of one between two taxa as measured by identity matrix, overlapped mutations at the same position do not increase molecular distances and are hence hallmarks of mutation saturation. At maximum saturation, each free-to-change position in a taxon would have mutated, resulting in a higher fraction of overlap positions among the non-conserved positions than expected by chance. This is termed the high overlap ratio (HOR) phenomenon.

    <p><strong>Figure. The genetic equidistance result and the maximum genetic diversity theory.</strong> A. Maximum genetic equidistance. A ten amino acid peptide is used to illustrate the evolution process. When the protein is fast evolving, the observed equidistance today would be maximum distance with a high overlap ratio. The figure shows 4 overlap positions with an overlap ratio 1. The distance of C-A is 60%, the same as that of B-A. This is a schematic representation of the original Margoliash genetic equidistance result. B. An example of maximum genetic equidistance. Alignment of human, drosophila, and yeast cytochrome C proteins. Human differs from drosophila in 22 amino acid positions. Human and drosophila are equidistant to yeast with 36 amino acid differences. There are 12 overlap positions (in red color) and the overlap ratio is 12/22 = 55%. Other mutant positions are colored in green, blue and orange. C. Linear genetic equidistance. When the protein is slowly evolving, assuming molecular clock holds, the observed equidistance today would be linear distance with a low overlap ratio. Here every substitution in any species would mean an increase in distance. The figure shows 0 overlap position with an overlap ratio 0. The distance of C-A is 50% and equals that of B-A. D. An example of linear equidistance. Human, orangutan, and mouse TXND9 gene alignment. There are 2 amino acid differences between human and orangutan, which are equidistant to mouse with 6 amino acid differences. The overlap ratio is 0/2 = 0.</p>
  </li> 

  <li id="genetic-non-equidistance"> 
    <strong>Genetic non-equidistance</strong>: The second way to test the molecular clock versus the MGD theory is the genetic non-equidistance result despite equidistance in time. The MGD theory predicts that maximum equidistance would only result when the outgroup is less complex than the sister species. If the outgroup is more complex, then its maximum distance with the ingroup sister species would be determined by the MGD of each of the ingroup species, which may not be the same for all the ingroup species. However, the molecular clock would predict genetic equidistance to the outgroup regardless if the outgroup taxon is more or less complex. For example, human is the outgroup to the Sauropsida clade containing snake and bird. The molecular clock predicts that humans should be equidistant to snakes and birds in protein sequence. However, the MGD theory predicts that birds should be closer to humans than snakes should because birds should be more complex than snakes.</li> 
    <p>The actual data validated the MGD theory. Genetic non-equidistance to humans despite equidistance in time has also been found for sister species within the teleost fish clade, the arthropod phylum, the Porifera phylum, and the fungi kingdom. In all five cases where the difference in complexity of the ingroup sister species can be intuitively inferred (octopus vs. cockle, terebratulina vs. lingula, bird vs. snake, dragonfly vs. louse, and smut vs. yeast), the more complex species always shows greater sequence similarity to humans in fast-evolving genes, fully conforming to the predictions of the MGD theory but not that of the molecular clock. It has recently been shown that octopus indeed has the lowest heterozygosity level among mollusks, and that the highest heterozygosity level among mollusks is found for the least complex solenogastres. Also, by whole genome sequencing analysis, two new world monkeys are found to be non-equidistant in nucleotide sequence to humans with the most primitive monkey marmoset to be more distant to humans than the owl monkey.</p> 

  <li id="ancient-dna-proteins"> 
    <strong>Ancient DNA/proteins</strong>: The third way to test the molecular clock versus the MGD theory is to make use of ancient DNA/proteins. Under the molecular clock (MC) and neutral theory, an ancient species should exhibit less sequence divergence from an outgroup than its extant sister species. However, the MGD theory posits that ancient DNA should be more divergent from the outgroup than its extant sister species. 
    <p>Consider three extant species of similar phenotypic complexity: A, B, and C, where A and B are sister ingroup species, and C is the outgroup. According to the GEP and MGD theory, A and B are equidistant to C, with the distance at an upper limit for fast-evolving genes. Due to differing environmental conditions, ancient species would share variants adapted to past environments, which would have been replaced in their extant lineages by alleles suited to current environments. Consequently, the genetic identity between B and C (or A and C, as BC = AC per the GEP) would be greater than that between ancient B and extant C. However, for slowly-evolving genes and for an ancient taxon from the relatively recent past, the B-C identity is expected to be comparable to the B(ancient)-C identity, as significant evolutionary changes are unlikely to accumulate over a relatively short period.</p>

<p>The maximum genetic diversity theory has been instrumental in directing productive research on both evolutionary problems and important biomedical problems. The theory does not mean discarding the old assumptions but merely making them more limited in their scopes. One must carefully select those DNAs that may follow those assumptions.</p> 

<h3 id="phylogenetics">Phylogenetics</h3> 
<p>The maximum genetic diversity theory should help resolve difficult historical problems such as the phylogenetic tree of life. Past methods have no concept of maximum distance and use mostly non-informative distance data for inferring phylogeny. The slow clock method based on the MGD theory makes use of only slow-evolving sequences and thus ensures the linear relationship between distance and time. Its results therefore will be more objective and independent of the variations in sequence selections and investigators. The slow clock method has re-established a primate phylogeny that humans and pongids are two separate groups, which has long been the consensus view of paleoanthropologists.</p> 

<p>To truly neutral sequences still at the linear phase of divergence, many of the assumptions of the neutral theory such as the infinite sites model would be valid. Thus phylogenetics research can largely proceed as before except that one now has a standard to separate the neutral from the noninformative DNAs. One must now distinguish two different kinds of high sequence similarity, one due to less time of separation and the other because of common construction resulting in using similar parts (convergent evolution).</p> 

<h3 id="origins">Origins of Modern Humans — Recent Out of East Asia Theory</h3> 
<p>The out of Africa model of modern human origins is based on the molecular clock and the neutral theory. The high genetic diversity of Africans is interpreted to mean a deeper evolutionary time for Africans if one assumes the molecular clock. Also, the infinite site model is assumed in order to infer the derived allele status, which is critical for rooting the phylogenetic tree in Africans by using the outgroup rooting method. However, both of these assumptions are invalid according to the MGD theory and experimental data. By using informative variants and allowing recurrent and back mutations, we have built a new model of modern human origins, the Recent out of East Asia (ROE) model. The ROE model is consistent with the multiregional model in terms of autosomal evidence, which indicates that the major races have separated for ~2 million years as originally claimed by the multiregional model. However, uniparental DNA data indicates a single origin in East Asia at a more recent time.</p> 

<p>The likely scenario is that modern humans first evolved in East Asia as marked by a new modern version of uniparental DNAs and then migrated to Europe and Africa and admixed with local less modern people. Admixture led to replacement of uniparental DNAs and autosomal DNAs so that Europeans or Africans would have modern uniparental DNAs but largely local autosomal DNAs. Ancient human DNA should be very informative in falsifying the incorrect models. Our analysis of ancient DNA samples has confirmed the ROE model. In contrast, researchers who believe in the out of Africa model have yet to report any ancient DNA evidence for their model but have instead found support for the ROE model, i.e., ancient DNA samples of 40,000–45,000 years old found in Europe and East Asia are East Asian-like rather than African-like.</p>

<h3 id="biomedical">Biomedical Problems — Complex Diseases and Traits</h3> 
<p>Most complex traits and diseases are partly inheritable and presumably caused by polymorphic genetic variations such as SNPs. The neutral theory views most such variations to be nonfunctional and neutral and hence the study of complex traits and diseases has in the past focused on searching for a few functional variants. Although such GWAS studies have met some successes in identifying a number of variants, these variants account for only a small fraction of the total trait variation and their functional roles typically remain unclear.</p> 

<p>The maximum genetic diversity theory predicts that complex diseases may be caused by excess genetic noise over a threshold and may serve to prevent an infinite increase in genetic diversity. Complex traits evolved as a result of suppressing genetic noises and hence should be susceptible to damage by excess noises. Also, insufficient amount of genetic diversity may hurt adaptive capacities such as immunity. The quantitative variations in a complex trait may correlate with the number of genetic variations.</p> 

<p>Results from our efforts in testing the MGD theory have shown the expected pattern that higher minor allele contents (MAC) or noises correlate with many complex diseases. These include association of MAC with higher lung cancer incidence in mice and humans. Also, Parkinson’s disease patients have higher MAC than controls and a selected set of ~37,000 minor alleles can predict 2% of Parkinson’s patients. Other diseases that show higher MAC include schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer, and Alzheimer’s.</p> 

<p>To directly examine the self-evident antagonistic relationship between cognition or consciousness and randomness or genetic diversity, we have performed a study analyzing the genotype and phenotype data from more than 400,000 people in the UK. We calculated multiple measures of genetic diversity for each individual, and examined which traits these measures were associated with using linear regression analysis that controlled for confounding factors. Among the 17 traits examined, only educational attainment, which is highly correlated with cognition or IQ, has the most robust relationship with genetic diversity, and it is an inverse association. This association is likely to be causal, since only the brain-expressed genes, but not the brain-non-expressed genes, showed an association. This result is likely to be free from the interference of confounding factors, because the correlation of non-synonymous variants is significantly higher than that of synonymous variants or intronic variants. Consistently, animal studies have also revealed an inverse relationship between learning and memory and genetic diversity.</p> 

<h3 id="why-sex">Why Sex?</h3> 
<p>Almost all eukaryotes reproduce sexually, through meiosis which generates haploid gametes from a diploid cell. The purpose of sex has long remained a mystery. The common explanation is that sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity. However, asexual organisms such as bacteria generally have much higher genetic diversity than eukaryotes. There is also the suggestion that sexual reproduction can remove chromosomal and epigenetic abnormalities or other deleterious mutations. However, such abnormalities could also be removed by natural selection of abnormal phenotypes.</p> 

<p>The MGD theory offers a straightforward solution to the mystery of sex. According to the theory, macroevolution from a simple taxon to a higher complexity taxon requires a reduction in genetic diversity (at the nucleotide level). The reduction in genetic diversity in an individual of the simple taxon is necessary for the individual to become the incipient individual of the more complex new taxon. As the overall level of genetic variation in an offspring is mostly determined by the inheritance of the combination of single nucleotide variants carried by the parents, sexual reproduction can either increase or decrease the genetic variation in an offspring relative to the parents, but asexual reproduction can only increase the genetic variation in an offspring. Thus, sexual reproduction is essential for reducing genetic diversity necessary for the macroevolution of higher complexity.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is the Maximum Genetic Diversity (MGD) theory?</dt>
        <dd>It is a theory of molecular evolution that explains genetic equidistance as a result of saturation at a diversity ceiling, not neutral drift.</dd>

        <dt>How does MGD differ from Neutral Theory?</dt>
        <dd>Neutral Theory assumes mutations accumulate randomly with time (molecular clock), while MGD emphasizes limits to diversity imposed by functional constraints.</dd>

        <dt>What does “Out of East Asia” mean?</dt>
        <dd>It is an alternative to the “Out of Africa” model, suggesting modern humans originated in East Asia, supported by genetic and fossil evidence.</dd>
